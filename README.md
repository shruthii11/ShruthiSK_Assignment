# Factors affecting housing price

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a data science model that explains how various economic factors impacted home prices over the last 20 years. The analysis includes linear regression and multiple regression with interaction and polynomial terms to understand the underlying drivers of home price changes and provide insights for future predictions.
